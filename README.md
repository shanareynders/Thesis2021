# Thesis2021
This repository contains the code for the thesis 'Neural networks with polynomial activation functions can be reduced to an eigenvalue problem'

Linear regression :
Both the code for the linear least-squares regression and the ridge regression can be found in 
- LinearRegression_Original : The original solution method for linear regression
- LinearRegressionAsEVP : linear regression reduced to an eigenvalue problem and solved with the Macaulay matrix method

The perceptron : 
- Percepron_original : the solution of the perceptron 

The perceptron : Output error 
- PerceptronAsEVPOutputError : Perceptron with the output error reduced to an eigenvalue problem and solved with the Macaulay matrix method

The perceptron : Equation error 
- PerceptronAsEVPEquationError : Perceptron with the equation error reduced to an eigenvalue problem and solved with the Macaulay matrix method

The functions needed to run this code can be found in the Foler 'Functions'
