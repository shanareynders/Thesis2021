# Thesis2021
This repository contains the code for the thesis 'Neural networks with polynomial activation functions can be reduced to an eigenvalue problem'

Linear regression :
Both the code for the linear least-squares regression and the ridge regression can be found in 
- LinearRegression_Original : The original solution method for linear regression
- LinearRegressionAsEVP : linear regression reduced to an eigenvalue problem and solved with the Macaulay matrix method

The perceptron : 
- Percepron_original : the solution of the perceptron 

The perceptron : Output error 
- PerceptronAsEVPOutputError : Perceptron with the output error reduced to an eigenvalue problem and solved with the Macaulay matrix method

The perceptron : Equation error 
- PerceptronAsEVPEquationError : Perceptron with the equation error reduced to an eigenvalue problem and solved with the Macaulay matrix method
